# elicitspeechweb
## Chrome App version

To build the Chrome app:

1. Change directory to the top level of the source tree, e.g.

cd ~/elicitspeechweb

2. Build the app with ant:

ant

This will leave a ZIP file in the "bin" subdirectory, which can be uploaded to the Chrome store.

*NB* Google has deprecated Chrome Apps except for Chromebooks, so the Chrome store will no longer
accept general Chrome browser apps.
